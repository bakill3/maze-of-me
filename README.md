# üé≠ Maze of Me

> *A deeply personal, narrative-driven psychological game built entirely in Python, harnessing user data, emotion, and advanced AI-driven NPC interactions.*

---

## üìñ Overview

**Maze of Me** is a command-line psychological adventure where your digital self is the foundation for a unique, emotional narrative. The game adapts to your profile, calendar, moods, and social connections, creating a different journey every session. Navigate a procedurally generated text maze, meet AI figures who remember your feelings and contacts, and discover how your online presence shapes your subconscious world.

OAuth logins (Spotify, Google, with Facebook & Instagram coming soon) bring in real data to create an interactive and personal experience.

## üß© Game Concept and Structure

Players awake in a mysterious maze. The story and rooms reference your real-world data, events, moods, and contacts, integrating your digital and emotional life into an interactive psychological narrative:

- **Act 1: Awakening**  
  Bright rooms and supportive AI figures welcome you. Upbeat music, selected from your top Spotify tracks and YouTube history, enhances the mood.

- **Act 2: Whispers**  
  Rooms and AI figures reference real calendar events, friends, or memories. NPCs become more challenging, sometimes asking about people in your contacts or your recent mood.

- **Act 3: Collapse and Reflection**  
  The maze responds to your feedback, looping through memories and feelings until you reach deeper self-understanding or choose to start over.

## üîë Features

### ‚úÖ Automated User Data Collection
- **Google OAuth**  
  - Fetches profile info, calendar events, YouTube history, and contacts (names, emails, birthdays).
- **Spotify OAuth**  
  - Collects your top tracks, audio features (valence, energy), and artists for music and narrative context.

### ‚úÖ Emotion-Aware AI Gameplay
- **Procedural Maze Generation**  
  - Every room is generated based on your real events, contacts, moods, and time of day.
  - Room descriptions and layouts are always unique and personalized.
- **Music as Mood**  
  - Each room's emotion is matched to your music using valence and energy from Spotify data.
  - Audio is preloaded using `yt-dlp` for instant playback and played with `pygame`.
  - Previous room's audio files are deleted automatically for optimal performance and minimal disk usage.
- **AI NPCs with Memory and Contact Awareness**  
  - NPCs use your contacts, recent emotions, and previous dialogue to generate deeply personal interactions.
  - The AI always gives a meaningful, context-aware reply, even if some data is missing.
  - Fallback logic ensures the game always continues smoothly.
- **Dialogue Trees**  
  - Each encounter lets you choose how to interact: "Who are you?", "Explain this room", "You‚Äôre lying", or "Stay silent".
  - Your emotional reactions (happy, sad, angry, neutral) are remembered and affect future AI responses.
- **AI Loading Spinner**  
  - When the AI is thinking, a real-time spinner keeps the CLI responsive until the NPC responds.
- **NPC Memory**  
  - NPCs can reference your prior feelings, choices, and even earlier NPCs within and across sessions.
- **Inspect and Use Room Items**  
  - You can inspect room furniture for additional context or NPC responses.

### ‚úÖ Enhanced CLI User Experience
- Modern CLI with color, typewriter effect, clear menus, and easy navigation.
- Help menu, graceful exits, and robust error handling.
- Detailed logging of all interactions for transparency and debugging.
