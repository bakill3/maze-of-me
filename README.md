## üìñ Overview

**Maze of Me** is a command-line psychological adventure where your digital self is the foundation for a unique, emotional narrative. The game adapts to your profile, calendar, moods, and social connections, creating a different journey every session. Navigate a procedurally generated text maze, meet AI figures who remember your feelings and contacts, and discover how your online presence shapes your subconscious world.

OAuth logins (Spotify, Google, with Facebook & Instagram coming soon) bring in real data to create an interactive and personal experience.

## üß© Game Concept and Structure

Players awake in a mysterious maze. The story and rooms reference your real-world data, events, moods, and contacts, integrating your digital and emotional life into an interactive psychological narrative:

- **Act 1: Awakening**  
  Bright rooms and supportive AI figures welcome you. Upbeat music, selected from your top Spotify tracks and YouTube history, enhances the mood.

- **Act 2: Whispers**  
  Rooms and AI figures reference real calendar events, friends, or memories. NPCs become more challenging, sometimes asking about people in your contacts or your recent mood.

- **Act 3: Collapse and Reflection**  
  The maze responds to your feedback, looping through memories and feelings until you reach deeper self-understanding or choose to start over.

## üîë Features

### ‚úÖ Automated User Data Collection
- **Google OAuth**  
  - Fetches: profile info, calendar events, YouTube watch history, **contacts (names, emails, birthdays), Gmail subjects (last 5), Google Tasks (top 10), and recently watched YouTube channels.**
  - All data is merged into your game profile and used for richer room/NPC generation.
- **Spotify OAuth**  
  - Collects: your top tracks, audio features (valence, energy), **top artists, favorite genres, liked tracks, and playlists.** All data is mapped to in-game moods and events for music and narrative context.

### ‚úÖ Emotion-Aware AI Gameplay
- **Procedural Maze & Room Generation**
  - Rooms are now generated using a much wider set of hooks: your calendar events, YouTube activity, contacts, Gmail, playlists, genres, and more.
  - **NPCs and room descriptions may reference your favorite artists, email subjects, playlists, and tasks.**
  - Room hooks and NPC context are more diverse, allowing each playthrough to be completely unique and personal.
- **Music as Mood**  
  - Each room's emotion is matched to your music using valence and energy from Spotify data.
  - Audio is preloaded using `yt-dlp` for instant playback and played with `pygame`.
  - Previous room's audio files are deleted automatically for optimal performance and minimal disk usage.
- **Advanced AI NPCs & Memory**
  - **NPCs now have ‚Äúmemory‚Äù**: they can recall your previous emotions, feedback, and even mention earlier NPC exchanges, moods, or player choices.
  - **Dialogue is now more deeply personalized**‚ÄîNPCs may reference your recent moods (‚ÄúI remember you were angry earlier‚Ä¶‚Äù), calendar events, contacts, or even subject lines from your recent emails.
  - **Dialogue choices and emotional feedback** influence subsequent AI responses, not just in the current room, but also across your whole session.
- **Inspect, Use, and Interact with Room Items**
  - You can now inspect or ‚Äúuse‚Äù furniture in each room for additional AI/NPC context, which may reference your personal data or prior actions.
  - Interactions are richer, sometimes involving a ‚Äúmini-game‚Äù or riddle based on your current mood or room context.
- **Persistent Save/Load Sessions**
  - The game now supports saving and continuing your journey later, preserving your room history, moods, and all NPC memory.
  - Stats and mood breakdowns are available at any time to track your psychological journey.
- **Robust Data & Performance**
  - Previous room audio files are deleted on transition for disk and performance optimization.
  - All major Google and Spotify data fields are now loaded, cached, and referenced in both gameplay and AI logic.
- **AI Loading Spinner**
  - Whenever the AI NPC is generating a response, a live spinner keeps the interface responsive.

### ‚úÖ Enhanced CLI User Experience
- Modern CLI with color, typewriter effect, clear menus, and easy navigation.
- Help menu, graceful exits, and robust error handling.
- Detailed logging of all interactions for transparency and debugging.
