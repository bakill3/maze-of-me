# üé≠ Maze of Me

> *A deeply personal, narrative-driven psychological game built entirely in Python, harnessing user data and AI-driven NPC interactions.*

## üìñ Overview

**Maze of Me** is a command-line psychological adventure game designed to immerse the player in a deeply personal narrative experience. The game dynamically adapts to the player's personal attributes and online presence, creating an emotionally resonant and profoundly unique gameplay journey. Players navigate through a dynamically generated text-based maze, interacting with emotionally charged rooms, AI-driven NPCs, and music curated specifically for them.

The game leverages OAuth logins (Spotify, Google, and eventually Facebook & Instagram) to gather user data and create a personalized, interactive experience.

## üß© Game Concept and Narrative Structure

Players awaken inside a mysterious maze, progressively uncovering memories, experiences, and subconscious thoughts. The game unfolds across three emotionally escalating acts:

- **Act 1: Awakening**  
  Rooms and interactions reflect neutral or positive emotions. Warm, upbeat music enhances the experience.

- **Act 2: Whispers**  
  Encounters become unsettling, referencing real-life events, relationships, and unresolved emotions from collected user data. NPCs become more confrontational, creating tension.

- **Act 3: Collapse & Reflection**  
  Reality breaks down, music distorts, and players face a profound psychological confrontation with their inner selves, culminating in self-reflection or a reset narrative loop.

## üîë Current Features & Implementation

### ‚úÖ User Profile Collection
- **Manual Data Entry**: Full name, age, date of birth (EU format: DD-MM-YYYY), height (flexible parsing in meters or centimeters), weight, eye color, hair color, and skin color.
- **Robust Input Handling**: Continuous validation loops, clear error messages, and confirmation steps ensure accurate data collection.

### ‚úÖ OAuth Integration (Spotify & Google)
- **Spotify Integration**: 
  - Authentication via OAuth with `spotipy`
  - Collection of user's top tracks, artists, and playlists
  - Analysis of audio features (valence, energy, tempo)
  - 30-second song previews identified for later retrieval (due to Spotify limitations, actual playback involves YouTube downloading)

- **Google Integration**:
  - OAuth authentication with `google-auth`
  - Fetching of user profile info (name, email, profile picture)
  - Import of Google Calendar events summaries
  - Optional import of YouTube watch history for deeply personalized interactions

### ‚úÖ Audio Playback Integration
- **YouTube Preloading**:
  - Using `yt-dlp` to automatically download audio previews matching the user's Spotify top tracks
  - Dynamic playback through `pygame.mixer` and/or `pydub`

- **Emotion-Based Soundtracking**:
  - Music selections are context-sensitive, aligning song moods (determined by Spotify's energy/valence metrics) with room atmospheres.

### ‚úÖ Dynamic Room & Maze Generation
- Room descriptions and layouts are dynamically generated using AI prompts tailored to user data and emotional contexts.
- Events tied to real-world context: Operating system date/time, calendar events, YouTube history, Spotify lyrics, etc.

### ‚úÖ NPC Interactions (AI-Powered)
- **NPC Dialogue**:
  - Powered by locally-run LLaMA 3 models (`llama.cpp`, Ollama, LM Studio)
  - Dialogue personalized with names of real contacts, phrases from YouTube and Spotify data, and generated hallucinated memories

- **Interaction Mechanics**:
  - Simple dialogue choices to interact with NPCs:
    - `"What are you talking about?"`
    - `"Stay silent"`
    - `"You‚Äôre not real."`

### ‚úÖ Enhanced User Experience
- Comprehensive CLI UX: robust parsing, clear help commands (`h`, `?`), graceful Ctrl+C exits, and terminal clearing for immersive sessions.
- Detailed logging via Python‚Äôs built-in `logging` module for debugging and future analytics.
